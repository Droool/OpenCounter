# openCounter 

openCounter is a clone of OpenTable, developed to showcase my knowledge as a fullstack developer. It's purpose is to facilitate the process of reserving tables at restaurants. This app is able to search for restaurants, give users information regarding the restaurant such as times available for reservations, available seating depending on party size, and provide the users the ability to make a reservation.
